libsp is a library that uses operator overloading and reflection for the
symbolic execution of C++ programs.

== Requirements ==

You need to install the Z3 4.0 theorem prover. It can be downloaded from:

  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/download.html

Extract the download to the solvers/ directory or install it globally.

== Installation == 

To build and install the library execute the following commands:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

If "make test" fails, you can still install, but it is likely that some
features of this library will not work correctly on your system.
Proceed at your own risk.

Note that "make install" may require superuser privileges.

For advanced usage information on other configure options refer to the
Autoconf documentation: http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

== Benchmarks ==

The benchmarks can be executed with "make bench".
