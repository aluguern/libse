libse is a library that uses operator overloading and new C++11 language
features to create an extensible native symbolic execution framework.
Native symbolic execution targets lightweight symbolic execution by
leveraging CPU architecture optimizations.

libse is distributed under a BSD-style license.

== Requirements ==

You need to install the Z3 v4.0 theorem prover. It can be downloaded from:

  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/download.html

Extract the download to the solvers/ directory or install it globally.
However, before you can do this, you need to fix the z3++.h header file
by inlining all member function declarations. A bug report has been sent
to Microsoft Research and this fix won't be needed in the future.

== Installation == 

To build and install the library execute the following commands:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

If "make test" fails, you can still install, but it is likely that some
features of this library will not work correctly on your system.
Proceed at your own risk.

Note that "make install" may require superuser privileges.

For advanced usage information on other configure options refer to the
Autoconf documentation: http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

== Troubleshooting ==

Since the library uses advanced C++11 language features, older compiler
versions are likely to be troublesome. To date, the library has been
successfully compiled on the following systems:

* GNU/Linux with GCC v4.6.3
* OS X with GCC v4.7.1

== Benchmarks ==

The benchmarks can be executed with "make bench".
