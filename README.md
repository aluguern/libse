# Libse

Libse is a library that uses operator overloading and new C++11 language
features to create an extensible native symbolic execution framework.
Native symbolic execution targets lightweight symbolic execution by
leveraging CPU architecture optimizations.

Libse is distributed under a [BSD-style license][bsd-license].

## Prerequisite

You need to compile the [Z3 theorem prover][z3]. Its source code is available
under the [Microsoft Research License Agreement][msr-la]:

    $ git clone https://git01.codeplex.com/z3

See the `z3/README` file for instructions on how to compile the Z3 source code
with any of the following compilers: Visual Studio, g++ or clang++.

## Installation

To build and install the library on Linux, execute the following commands:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

On OS X, you may have to specify clang++ explicitly:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure CXX=clang++
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

If `make test` fails, you can still install, but it is likely that some
features of this library will not work correctly on your system.
Proceed at your own risk.

Note that `make install` may require superuser privileges.

For advanced usage information on other configure options refer to the
[Autoconf documentation][autoconf].

## Documentation

Browse the [API documentation][api] online.

If Doxygen is installed, the documentation can be generated by:

    $ make doc

## Troubleshooting

Since the library uses advanced C++11 language features, older compiler
versions are likely to be troublesome. To date, the library has been
successfully compiled on the following systems:

* GNU/Linux with GCC v4.6.3
* OS X with GCC v4.7.1

## Benchmarks

The benchmarks can be executed with `make bench`.
