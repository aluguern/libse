# Libse

Libse is a library that uses operator overloading and new C++11 language
features to create an extensible native symbolic execution framework.
Native symbolic execution targets lightweight symbolic execution by
leveraging CPU architecture optimizations.

Libse is distributed under a [BSD-style license][bsd-license].

## Prerequisite

You need to install [Z3][z3], [MathSAT5][msat] and [SMT Kit][smt-kit]. Installation
instructions can be found in SMT Kit's `solvers` directory.

[z3]: http://z3.codeplex.com/
[msat]: http://mathsat.fbk.eu/
[smt-kit]: https://github.com/ahorn/smt-kit

## Installation

To build and install the library on Linux, execute the following commands:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

On OS X, you may build and install the library with clang++:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS=-stdlib=libc++
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

If `make test` fails, you can still install, but it is likely that some
features of this library will not work correctly on your system.
Proceed at your own risk.

Note that `make install` may require superuser privileges.

For advanced usage information on other configure options refer to the
[Autoconf documentation][autoconf].

## Documentation

Browse the [API documentation][api] online.

If Doxygen is installed, the documentation can be generated by:

    $ make doc

## Troubleshooting

Since the library uses advanced C++11 language features, older compiler
versions are likely to be troublesome. To date, the library has been
successfully compiled on the following systems:

* GNU/Linux with GCC v4.6.3
* OS X with GCC v4.7.1

## Benchmarks

The benchmarks can be executed with `make bench`.
